'''Speech recognition''' is the  WIKILINK  subfield of  WIKILINK  that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and  WIKILINK  of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as '''automatic speech recognition''' ('''ASR'''), '''computer speech recognition''' or '''speech to text''' ('''STT'''). It incorporates knowledge and research in the  WIKILINK ,  WIKILINK , and  WIKILINK  fields.

Some speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated  WIKILINK  into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker independent\" REFERENCE  systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\".

Speech recognition applications include  WIKILINK s such as voice dialing (e.g. \"call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"),  WIKILINK  appliance control, search (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, REFERENCE  speech-to-text processing (e.g.,  WIKILINK s or  WIKILINK s), and  WIKILINK  (usually termed  WIKILINK ).

{{anchor|vs_voice_rec}}The term ''voice recognition'' NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF  or '' LEFTWIKILINK '' REFERENCE  REFERENCE  refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying.  LEFTWIKILINK  can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.

From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in  WIKILINK  and  WIKILINK . The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.

==History==
The key areas of growth were: vocabulary size, speaker independence and processing speed.

===Pre-1970===
* '''1952''' – Three Bell Labs researchers, Stephen Balashek, REFERENCE  R. Biddulph, and K. H. Davis built a system called \"Audrey\" REFERENCE  for single-speaker digit recognition. Their system located the  WIKILINK  in the power spectrum of each utterance. REFERENCE
* '''1960''' –  WIKILINK  developed and published the  WIKILINK .
* '''1962''' – IBM demonstrated its 16-word \"Shoebox\" machine's speech recognition capability at the 1962 World's Fair.<ref name=PCW.Siri>{{cite magazine  |magazine=PC World  |accessdate=22 October 2018

* '''1969''' – Funding at Bell Labs dried up for several years when, in 1969, the influential  LEFTWIKILINK  wrote an open letter that was critical of and defunded speech recognition research.<ref name=jasapierce>{{cite journal

   |bibcode=1969ASAJ...46.1049P}}</ref> This defunding lasted until Pierce retired and  WIKILINK  took over.

 WIKILINK  was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at  WIKILINK  in the late 1960s. Previous systems required users to pause after each word. Reddy's system issued spoken commands for playing game  WIKILINK .

Around this time Soviet researchers invented the  WIKILINK  (DTW) algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200-word vocabulary. REFERENCE  DTW processed speech by dividing it into short frames, e.g. 10ms segments, and processing each frame as a single unit. Although DTW would be superseded by later algorithms, the technique carried on. Achieving speaker independence remained unsolved at this time period.

===1970–1990===
* '''1971''' –  WIKILINK  funded five years for ''Speech Understanding Research'', speech recognition research seeking a minimum vocabulary size of 1,000 words. They thought  LEFTWIKILINK  would be key to making progress in speech ''recognition'';, this later proved to untrue. REFERENCE   LEFTWIKILINK ,  WIKILINK ,  WIKILINK  and  WIKILINK  all participated in the program. REFERENCE  REFERENCE  This revived speech recognition research post John Pierce's letter.

* '''1972''' - The IEEE Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing group held a conference in Newton, Massachusetts.
* '''1976''' The first  WIKILINK  was held in  WIKILINK , which since then has been a major venue for the publication of research on speech recognition. REFERENCE

During the late 1960s  LEFTWIKILINK  developed the mathematics of  WIKILINK s at the  WIKILINK . A decade later, at CMU, Raj Reddy's students  LEFTWIKILINK  and  WIKILINK  began using the  WIKILINK  (HMM) for speech recognition. REFERENCE  James Baker had learned about HMMs from a summer job at the Institute of Defense Analysis during his undergraduate education.<ref name=\"James Baker interview\"/> The use of HMMs allowed researchers to combine different sources of knowledge, such as acoustics, language, and syntax, in a unified probabilistic model.

* By the '''mid-1980s''' IBM's  LEFTWIKILINK  team created a voice activated typewriter called Tangora, which could handle a 20,000-word vocabulary REFERENCE  Jelinek's statistical approach put less emphasis on emulating the way the human brain processes and understands speech in favor of using statistical modeling techniques like HMMs. (Jelinek's group independently discovered the application of HMMs to speech.<ref name=\"James Baker interview\">{{cite web

The 1980s also saw the introduction of the  WIKILINK  language model.

* '''1987''' –  The  LEFTWIKILINK  allowed language models to use multiple length n-grams, and  WIKILINK  used HMM to recognize languages.
<!-- CSELT was spun off; see CSELT Wiki article for details. -->

Much of the progress in the field is owed to the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers. At the end of the DARPA program in 1976, the best computer available to researchers was the  WIKILINK  with 4 MB ram.<ref name=\"Communications of the ACM\"/> It could take up to 100 minutes to decode just 30 seconds of speech.

By this point, the vocabulary of the typical commercial speech recognition system was larger than the average human vocabulary.<ref name=\"Communications of the ACM\"/> Raj Reddy's former student,  WIKILINK , developed the  LEFTWIKILINK  system at CMU. The Sphinx-II system was the first to do speaker-independent, large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition and it had the best performance in DARPA's 1992 evaluation. Handling continuous speech with a large vocabulary was a major milestone in the history of speech recognition. Huang went on to found the  LEFTWIKILINK  in 1993. Raj Reddy's student  WIKILINK  joined Apple where, in 1992, he helped develop a speech interface prototype for the Apple computer known as Casper.

 WIKILINK , a Belgium-based speech recognition company, acquired several other companies, including Kurzweil Applied Intelligence in 1997 and Dragon Systems in 2000. The L&H speech technology was used in the  WIKILINK  operating system. L&H was an industry leader until an accounting scandal brought an end to the company in 2001. The speech technology from L&H was bought by ScanSoft which became  LEFTWIKILINK  in 2005.  LEFTWIKILINK  originally licensed software from Nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant  WIKILINK . REFERENCE

====2000s====
In the 2000s DARPA sponsored two speech recognition programs: Effective Affordable Reusable Speech-to-Text (EARS) in 2002 and  LEFTWIKILINK  (GALE). Four teams participated in the EARS program:  WIKILINK , a team led by  LEFTWIKILINK  with  WIKILINK  and  LEFTWIKILINK ,
 WIKILINK , and a team composed of  LEFTWIKILINK ,  LEFTWIKILINK  and  WIKILINK . EARS funded the collection of the Switchboard telephone speech corpus containing 260 hours of recorded conversations from over 500 speakers. REFERENCE  The GALE program focused on  LEFTWIKILINK  and  LEFTWIKILINK  broadcast news speech.  WIKILINK 's first effort at speech recognition came in 2007 after hiring some researchers from Nuance. REFERENCE  The first product was  WIKILINK , a telephone based directory service. The recordings from GOOG-411 produced valuable data that helped Google improve their recognition systems.  WIKILINK  is now supported in over 30 languages.

In the United States, the  WIKILINK  has made use of a type of speech recognition for  WIKILINK  since at least 2006. REFERENCE  This technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of keywords. Recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest. Some government research programs focused on intelligence applications of speech recognition, e.g. DARPA's EARS's program and  WIKILINK 's  LEFTWIKILINK  program.

In the early 2000s, speech recognition was still dominated by traditional approaches such as  WIKILINK  combined with feedforward  WIKILINK . NAMEDREF
Today, however, many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a  WIKILINK  method called  WIKILINK  (LSTM), a  WIKILINK  published by  WIKILINK  &  WIKILINK  in 1997.<ref name=lstm>{{cite journal

Around 2007, LSTM trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) NAMEDREF  started to outperform traditional speech recognition in certain applications. NAMEDREF  In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through  WIKILINK  to all smartphone users. NAMEDREF

The use of deep feedforward (non-recurrent) networks for  WIKILINK ing was introduced during later part of 2009 by  WIKILINK  and his students at University of Toronto and by Li Deng REFERENCE  and colleagues at Microsoft Research, initially in the collaborative work between Microsoft and University of Toronto which was subsequently expanded to include IBM and Google (hence \"The shared views of four research groups\" subtitle in their 2012 review paper). NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF  In contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades, the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by 30%.<ref name=\"Scientists-see-advances\"/> This innovation was quickly adopted across the field. Researchers have begun to use deep learning techniques for language modeling as well.

In the long history of speech recognition, both shallow form and deep form (e.g. recurrent nets) of artificial neural networks had been explored for many years during 1980s, 1990s and a few years into the 2000s. NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF
But these methods never won over the non-uniform internal-handcrafting  LEFTWIKILINK / WIKILINK  (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. NAMEDREF
A number of key difficulties had been methodologically analyzed in the 1990s, including gradient diminishing NAMEDREF  and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models. NAMEDREF  NAMEDREF
All these difficulties were in addition to the lack of big training data and big computing power in these early days. Most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers hence subsequently moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling approaches until the recent resurgence of deep learning starting around 2009–2010 that had overcome all these difficulties. Hinton et al. and Deng et al. reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups (University of Toronto, Microsoft, Google, and IBM) ignited a renaissance of applications of deep feedforward neural networks to speech recognition.

====2010s====
By early 2010s ''speech'' recognition, also called voice recognition REFERENCE  REFERENCE  REFERENCE  was clearly differentiated from ''sp<u>eaker</u>'' recognition, and speaker independence was considered a major breakthrough. Until then, systems required a \"training\" period.

==Models, methods, and algorithms==
Both  WIKILINK ing and  WIKILINK ing are important parts of modern statistically-based speech recognition algorithms. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as  WIKILINK  or  WIKILINK .

===Hidden Markov models===
{{Main|Hidden Markov model}}
Modern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a  WIKILINK . Speech can be thought of as a  WIKILINK  for many stochastic purposes.

Another reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of ''n''-dimensional real-valued vectors (with ''n'' being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of  LEFTWIKILINK  coefficients, which are obtained by taking a  WIKILINK  of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a  WIKILINK , then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each  WIKILINK , will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.

Described above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need  WIKILINK  for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use  WIKILINK  to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and  WIKILINK  (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called  LEFTWIKILINK  and  WIKILINK s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use  WIKILINK  (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use  LEFTWIKILINK  and an  LEFTWIKILINK -based projection followed perhaps by  WIKILINK  linear discriminant analysis or a  WIKILINK  transform (also known as  WIKILINK , or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum  WIKILINK  (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE).

Decoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the  WIKILINK  to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the  WIKILINK , or FST, approach).

A possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function ( LEFTWIKILINK ) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the  WIKILINK  approach) or as a subset of the models (a  LEFTWIKILINK ). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the  WIKILINK  REFERENCE  (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the  WIKILINK , though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score  LEFTWIKILINK  represented as weighted  WIKILINK  with  WIKILINK s represented themselves as a  WIKILINK  verifying certain assumptions. REFERENCE

===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===
{{Main|Dynamic time warping}}

Dynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.

Dynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics&nbsp;– indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.

A well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \"warped\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural network}}
Neural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s. Since then, neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification, REFERENCE  isolated word recognition, REFERENCE  audiovisual speech recognition, audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation.

 LEFTWIKILINK  make fewer explicit assumptions about feature statistical properties than HMMs and have several qualities making them attractive recognition models for speech recognition. When used to estimate the probabilities of a speech feature segment, neural networks allow discriminative training in a natural and efficient manner.  However, in spite of their effectiveness in classifying short-time units such as individual phonemes and isolated words, REFERENCE , early neural networks were rarely successful for continuous recognition tasks because of their limited ability to model temporal dependencies.

One approach to this limitation was to use neural networks as a pre-processing, feature transformation or dimensionality reduction, REFERENCE  step prior to HMM based recognition.  However, more recently, LSTM and related recurrent neural networks (RNNs) NAMEDREF  REFERENCE  and Time Delay Neural Networks(TDNN's) REFERENCE  have demonstrated improved performance in this area.



====Deep feedforward and recurrent neural networks====
{{Main|Deep learning}}

Deep Neural Networks and Denoising  WIKILINK s REFERENCE  are also under investigation.  A deep feedforward neural network (DNN) is an  WIKILINK  with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers.<ref name=HintonDengYu2012/> Similar to shallow neural networks, DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models, where extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, giving a huge learning capacity and thus the potential of modeling complex patterns of speech data.<ref name=BOOK2014/>

A success of DNNs in large vocabulary speech recognition occurred in 2010 by industrial researchers, in collaboration with academic researchers, where large output layers of the DNN based on context dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees were adopted.

recent overview articles. REFERENCE  NAMEDREF

One fundamental principle of  WIKILINK  is to do away with hand-crafted  WIKILINK  and to use raw features. This principle was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features, NAMEDREF  showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features which contain a few stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms.
The true \"raw\" features of speech, waveforms, have more recently been shown to produce excellent larger-scale speech recognition results. NAMEDREF

=== End-to-end automatic speech recognition ===
Since 2014, there has been much research interest in \"end-to-end\" ASR. Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all  LEFTWIKILINK -based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and  WIKILINK . End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a  LEFTWIKILINK  is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices. REFERENCE  Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from  WIKILINK  and  LEFTWIKILINK  (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.

The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by  LEFTWIKILINK  of  LEFTWIKILINK  and Navdeep Jaitly of the  WIKILINK  in 2014. REFERENCE  The model consisted of  WIKILINK s and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to  WIKILINK  assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later,  WIKILINK  expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English. REFERENCE  In 2016,  WIKILINK  presented LipNet, REFERENCE  the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset. REFERENCE  A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by  LEFTWIKILINK  achieving 6 times better performance than human experts. NAMEDREF

An alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of  WIKILINK  and  WIKILINK  and Bahdanau et al. of the  LEFTWIKILINK  in 2016. REFERENCE  REFERENCE  The model named \"Listen, Attend and Spell\" (LAS), literally \"listens\" to the acoustic signal, pays \"attention\" to different parts of the signal and \"spells\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for deployment onto applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model). REFERENCE  Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model. Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) was proposed by  WIKILINK ,  LEFTWIKILINK  and  WIKILINK  to directly emit sub-word units which are more natural than English characters; REFERENCE   WIKILINK  and  LEFTWIKILINK  extended LAS to \"Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell\" (WLAS) to handle lip reading surpassing human-level performance. REFERENCE

==Applications==

===In-car systems===
Typically a manual control input, for example by means of a finger control on the steering-wheel, enables the speech recognition system and this is signalled to the driver by an audio prompt. Following the audio prompt, the system has a \"listening window\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Simple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent{{When|date=April 2014}} car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Health care===

====Medical documentation====
In the  WIKILINK  sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a  WIKILINK  system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.

One of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the  WIKILINK  ( LEFTWIKILINK ) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \"Meaningful Use\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an  WIKILINK  or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a  WIKILINK ) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.

A more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \"macros\", where the use of certain phrases – e.g., \"normal report\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam – e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.

As an alternative to this navigation by hand, cascaded use of speech recognition and information extraction has been studied REFERENCE  as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. The results are encouraging, and the paper also opens data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing software, to the research and development community for studying clinical documentation and language-processing.

====Therapeutic use====
Prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with  WIKILINK s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in  WIKILINK  patients who have been treated with  LEFTWIKILINK . Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Military===

====High-performance fighter aircraft====
Substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in  WIKILINK . Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the  LEFTWIKILINK / WIKILINK  aircraft ( WIKILINK ), the program in France for  LEFTWIKILINK  aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.

Working with Swedish pilots flying in the  LEFTWIKILINK  Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing  LEFTWIKILINK . The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially. REFERENCE

The  WIKILINK , currently in service with the UK  WIKILINK , employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot  WIKILINK , REFERENCE  and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands. REFERENCE

Speaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the  LEFTWIKILINK  (JSF) and the  WIKILINK  lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%. REFERENCE

====Helicopters====
The problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the  WIKILINK  environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a  LEFTWIKILINK , which would reduce acoustic noise in the  WIKILINK . Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the  WIKILINK  Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment ( LEFTWIKILINK ) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the  WIKILINK . There has also been much useful work in  WIKILINK . Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of  WIKILINK  systems, and control of an automated target handover system.

As in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall  WIKILINK  in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.

====Training air traffic controllers====
Training for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \"pseudo-pilot\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation.
Speech recognition and  LEFTWIKILINK  techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.

The USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Telephony and other domains===
ASR is now commonplace in the field of  WIKILINK  and is becoming more widespread in the field of  WIKILINK  and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with  WIKILINK  systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.

The improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in  WIKILINK s. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.

=== Usage in education and daily life ===
For  WIKILINK , speech recognition can be useful for learning a  WIKILINK . It can teach proper pronunciation, in addition to helping a person develop fluency with their speaking skills. REFERENCE

Students who are blind (see  WIKILINK ) or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them, as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice, instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard. NAMEDREF <!--second host of same journal, if this becomes deadlink: http://www.ldonline.org/article/38655/ -->

Students who are physically disabled or suffer from  WIKILINK /other injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting, typing, or working with scribe on school assignments by using speech-to-text programs. They can also utilize speech recognition technology to freely enjoy searching the Internet or using a computer at home without having to physically operate a mouse and keyboard.<ref name=brainline />

Speech recognition can allow students with learning disabilities to become better writers. By saying the words aloud, they can increase the fluidity of their writing, and be alleviated of concerns regarding spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of writing. REFERENCE  Also, see  WIKILINK .

Use of voice recognition software, in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a personal computer running word-processing software has proven to be positive for restoring damaged short-term-memory capacity, in stroke and craniotomy individuals.

===People with disabilities===
People with disabilities can benefit from speech recognition programs. For individuals that are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, speech recognition software is used to automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations such as discussions in conference rooms, classroom lectures, and/or religious services. REFERENCE

Speech recognition is also very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands, ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to involve disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices. In fact, people who used the keyboard a lot and developed  LEFTWIKILINK  became an urgent early market for speech recognition. REFERENCE  REFERENCE  Speech recognition is used in  WIKILINK   WIKILINK , such as voicemail to text,  WIKILINK , and  LEFTWIKILINK . Individuals with learning disabilities who have problems with thought-to-paper communication (essentially they think of an idea but it is processed incorrectly causing it to end up differently on paper) can possibly benefit from the software but the technology is not bug proof. REFERENCE  Also the whole idea of speak to text can be hard for intellectually disabled person's due to the fact that it is rare that anyone tries to learn the technology to teach the person with the disability. REFERENCE

This type of technology can help those with dyslexia but other disabilities are still in question. The effectiveness of the product is the problem that is hindering it being effective. Although a kid may be able to say a word depending on how clear they say it the technology may think they are saying another word and input the wrong one. Giving them more work to fix, causing them to have to take more time with fixing the wrong word. REFERENCE

==Performance==
The performance of speech recognition systems is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed. REFERENCE  REFERENCE  Accuracy is usually rated with  WIKILINK  (WER), whereas speed is measured with the  WIKILINK . Other measures of accuracy include  WIKILINK  (SWER) and  WIKILINK  (CSR).

Speech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following: REFERENCE {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
* Vocabulary size and confusability
* Speaker dependence versus independence
* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech
* Task and language constraints
* Read versus spontaneous speech
* Adverse conditions

===Accuracy===
As mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:
* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows:
::e.g. the 10 digits \"zero\" to \"nine\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively.
* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusable words:
::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusable words (most notoriously, the E-set: \"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* Speaker dependence vs. independence:
::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.<br />
::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).
* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech
::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.<br />
With discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. <br />
With continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.


* Task and language constraints
**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \"The apple is red.\"
**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \"The apple is angry.\"
**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \"Red is apple the.\"

Constraints are often represented by a grammar.
* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech – When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \"uh\" and \"um\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary.
* Adverse conditions – Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)<br />
Speech recognition is a multi-levelled pattern recognition task.
* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g.  WIKILINK s, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;
* Each level provides additional constraints;
e.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level;
* This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches:
* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize
For telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second;
* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);
computed every 10&nbsp;ms, with one 10&nbsp;ms section called a frame;

Analysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions:  WIKILINK  (how strong is it), and  WIKILINK  (how often it vibrates per second).

===Security concerns===
Speech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation.  For example, activation words like \"Alexa\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action. REFERENCE  Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside.  Attackers may be able to gain access to personal information, like calendar, address book contents, private messages, and documents.  They may also be able to impersonate the user to send messages or make online purchases.

Two attacks have been demonstrated that use artificial sounds.  One transmits ultrasound and attempt to send commands without nearby people noticing. REFERENCE  The other adds small, inaudible distortions to other speech or music that are specially crafted to confuse the specific speech recognition system into recognizing music as speech, or to make what sounds like one command to a human sound like a different command to the system. REFERENCE

=== Conferences and journals ===
Popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include SpeechTEK and SpeechTEK Europe,  LEFTWIKILINK ,  WIKILINK /Eurospeech, and the IEEE ASRU. Conferences in the field of  WIKILINK , such as  LEFTWIKILINK ,  LEFTWIKILINK , EMNLP, and HLT, are beginning to include papers on  WIKILINK . Important journals include the  WIKILINK  Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing (later renamed  WIKILINK  Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing and since Sept 2014 renamed  WIKILINK /ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing—after merging with an ACM publication), Computer Speech and Language, and Speech Communication.

=== Books ===
Books like \"Fundamentals of Speech Recognition\" by  WIKILINK  can be useful to acquire basic knowledge but may not be fully up to date (1993). Another good source can be \"Statistical Methods for Speech Recognition\" by  WIKILINK  and \"Spoken Language Processing (2001)\" by  WIKILINK  etc. More up to date are \"Computer Speech\", by  WIKILINK , second edition published in 2004, and \"Speech Processing: A Dynamic and Optimization-Oriented Approach\" published in 2003 by Li Deng and Doug O'Shaughnessey. The recently updated textbook ''Speech and Language Processing'' (2008) by  LEFTWIKILINK  and Martin presents the basics and the state of the art for ASR.  WIKILINK  also uses the same features, most of the same front-end processing, and classification techniques as is done in speech recognition. A most recent comprehensive textbook, \"Fundamentals of Speaker Recognition\" is an in depth source for up to date details on the theory and practice. NAMEDREF  A good insight into the techniques used in the best modern systems can be gained by paying attention to government sponsored evaluations such as those organised by  WIKILINK  (the largest speech recognition-related project ongoing as of 2007 is the GALE project, which involves both speech recognition and translation components).

A good and accessible introduction to speech recognition technology and its history is provided by the general audience book \"The Voice in the Machine. Building Computers That Understand Speech\" by  WIKILINK  (2012).

The most recent book on speech recognition is ''Automatic Speech Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach'' (Publisher: Springer) written by D. Yu and L. Deng and published near the end of 2014, with highly mathematically oriented technical detail on how deep learning methods are derived and implemented in modern speech recognition systems based on DNNs and related deep learning methods. NAMEDREF  A related book, published earlier in 2014, \"Deep Learning: Methods and Applications\" by L. Deng and D. Yu provides a less technical but more methodology-focused overview of DNN-based speech recognition during 2009–2014, placed within the more general context of deep learning applications including not only speech recognition but also image recognition, natural language processing, information retrieval, multimodal processing, and multitask learning. NAMEDREF

=== Software ===
In terms of freely available resources,  WIKILINK 's  LEFTWIKILINK  toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting. Another resource (free but copyrighted) is the  LEFTWIKILINK  book (and the accompanying HTK toolkit). For more recent and state-of-the-art techniques,  LEFTWIKILINK  toolkit can be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A demonstration of an on-line speech recognizer is available on Cobalt's webpage. REFERENCE
