# donovanrichardson.github.io

Created in May 2019 to house my [BABYTALK](https://donovanrichardson.github.io/bookbag/babytalk.html) project from the [Boston Stupid Hackthon](https://bostonstupidhackathon.com/). 

Since then, I've added a few more projects, detailed below.

[CANDIDATES](https://donovanrichardson.github.io/candidates.html), a fun way for me to learn about the Democratic presidential candidates by text mining their Wikipedia pages.

[Job-DB](https://github.com/donovanrichardson/donovanrichardson.github.io/tree/master/job-db), a command line program that keeps track of job applications in a MySQL database.

[A timetable program](https://github.com/donovanrichardson/donovanrichardson.github.io/tree/master/TransitFetch) in progress, aiming to create timetables like [this one](http://hiyoshizaka.tokyo/timetable_train_shirokanetakanawa.html) or [this one](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4trkojk410ya8j/lirrschedule.docx?dl=0) for transit routes, using GTFS data.
