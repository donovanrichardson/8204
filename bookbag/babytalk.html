        <p>
            <strong><em>
                Defending infant literacy is among the most important challenges facing our society.
                </em></strong>

            <br>
            BABYTALK supports the literacy of children across America by reducing the number of letters required for reading.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, the English language has 26 letters, and while that's just fine for the big kids and for the adults, babies' brains and mouths just can't handle all of the letters. BABYTALK's technology lets you reduce the number of letters in text, so that you can make reading easy for your baby.

                Preamble to the Constitution of Massachusetts
                The end of the institution, maintenance, and administration of government, is to secure the existence of the body politic, to protect it, and to furnish the individuals who compose it with the power of enjoying in safety and tranquility their natural rights, and the blessings of life: and whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the government, and to take measures necessary for their safety, prosperity and happiness.
